# Fit the per-gene null model that the simulation tests against, once per replicate.
#
# WHY THIS STEP EXISTS
#
# Before testing a pair, sceptre fits a Poisson GLM of the gene's counts on the cell covariates
# (perform_response_precomputation) -- the null model the perturbed cells are compared against. It
# skips that fit whenever @response_precomputations already holds an entry for the response_id.
#
# sceptre_template.rds used to inherit 272 such entries from the *real* discovery analysis, covering
# all 237 genes with QC-passing pairs, so every simulated count was tested against coefficients
# fitted to real counts. Measured, that understates power: 7 of 265 discovery calls flipped against a
# faithful refit and all 7 flipped the same way. See docs/status.md.
#
# The faithful alternative -- refitting inside every call -- costs 4.3x, because each pair in a call
# is a distinct gene and so the refit scales with pairs. This script buys the fidelity back. A gene's
# null model is fitted on counts with *no knockdown anywhere*, which makes it independent of both the
# target and the effect size, so one fit per (gene, replicate) serves every target the gene pairs
# with (~147 on average) and the whole effect-size sweep. That is why this is a separate step rather
# than something run_power_simulation.R does inline: targets are spread over ~1,000 array tasks, and
# fitting per task would pay for it ~1,000 times instead of once.
#
# Output is small. One entry is 11 named coefficients plus a theta scalar, so 100 replicates x ~272
# genes is a few hundred KB.
#
# Usage:
#   fit_null_models.R --sim-input sim_input.rds --sceptre-template sceptre_template.rds \
#     --grna-targets grna_targets.tsv --reps 100 --seed 20250812 --out null_precomputations.rds
