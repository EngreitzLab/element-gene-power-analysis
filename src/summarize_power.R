# power column per effect size -- without that script's dependencies on `distances`,
# `guide_targets` and `features` files, none of which the pipeline produces.
#
# It also derives the quantity the analysis is usually actually after: the smallest tested effect
# size at which a pair reaches a target power. See --power-threshold.

# Usage:
#   summarize_power.R --power power_es0.15.tsv,power_es0.2.tsv --out power_summary.tsv

# Per-gene values from sim_input, joined here rather than carried through the simulation.
#
# WHY HERE. The test statistic's variance goes as SE^2 ~ (1/n_pert_cells) * (1/mu + 1/theta), so an
# analytical power estimate (PerturbPlan's closed form) needs the gene's dispersion as well as its
# expression. Only
# `average_expression_all_cells` reaches this table through the per-simulation output, so every such
# analysis has had to load a 16 MB sim_input.rds to find the other half. Joining it here costs one
# read and makes the summary self-sufficient.
#
# It is done at this step, and not by having run_power_simulation.R emit a `dispersion` column,
# because that would only help sweeps run AFTER the change -- an existing sweep's per-simulation
# output is already written, and re-running it to add a per-gene constant would cost thousands of
# CPU-hours. Summarising again from stored power tables costs seconds.
#
# `gene_mean` comes along because it is the mu in that formula and is NOT the same quantity as
# `average_expression_all_cells`: they correlate at r = 0.9999 but differ by a scale factor (median
# ratio 0.84 on day0), since one is size-factor normalised and the other is not. Adding only the
# dispersion would leave the formula still needing the RDS, which is the problem this solves.

# Optional throughout: with no --sim-input the columns are simply absent, so nothing downstream
# that predates them can break.

## DERIVED =========================================================================================

# Smallest tested effect size from which a pair is detectable. NA means no tested effect size
# qualified, which is a statement about the effect sizes you ran, not proof the pair is
# undetectable -- so the largest effect size tested is reported alongside it for context.
#
# TWO CHOICES ARE BAKED IN HERE AND BOTH CHANGE HOW THE COLUMN CAN BE USED.
#
# 1. THE SUFFIX RULE. A pair qualifies at effect size e only if it clears the threshold at e *and*
#    at every larger effect size tested. Taking the first effect size that clears, in isolation,
#    lets Monte-Carlo noise win: at 100 simulations a pair whose true power is 0.75 clears 0.8
#    around a third of the time, so across six effect sizes a spurious early clear is likely, and
#    the error is one-directional -- it always reports the pair as more detectable than it is.
#    "Detectable from e upwards" is also the claim the column gets used to make.
#
#    Effect sizes a pair was not tested at are unknown, not failures, so they cannot block a
#    suffix and are skipped.
#
# 2. THREE BASES, because the interval on power carries through to an interval on this. Power is
#    monotone in effect size, so thresholding a *lower* bound on power yields a *larger* effect
#    size -- the direction inverts:
#
#      min_detectable_effect_size           from `power`          point estimate
#      min_detectable_effect_size_ci_low    from `power_ci_high`  optimistic edge
#      min_detectable_effect_size_ci_high   from `power_ci_low`   conservative edge
#
#    For "this pair was powered well enough that a non-significant result means something", the
#    conservative edge is the one to use: the smallest knockdown the data can *establish* the assay
#    would have caught. See docs/output.md.
