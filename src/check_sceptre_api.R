# Guard against silent breakage from a sceptre upgrade.
#
# This pipeline reaches into sceptre's *internal* S4 slots rather than going through its
# public API: it swaps the response matrix for simulated counts, narrows the discovery
# pairs to one perturbation, and reads the cached negative-binomial precomputations. None
# of that is part of sceptre's documented interface, so a new sceptre release can change
# it without a deprecation warning and the pipeline would keep running while producing
# wrong numbers.
#
# This script fails loudly if anything the pipeline depends on has moved. Run it after
# `pixi run setup` and after any change to the pinned SHA.
#
# Usage:  pixi run check-api
