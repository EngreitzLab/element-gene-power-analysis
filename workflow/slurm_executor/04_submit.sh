# Submit the step 4 simulation array.
#
# This wrapper exists because the array range depends on N_SPLITS x the number of effect sizes,
# and #SBATCH directives are read before the script runs, so they cannot reference config.sh.
# Rather than keep a literal --array in sync by hand -- a footgun that silently skips work when
# it drifts -- the range is computed here and passed on the command line, which overrides any
# directive.
#
# Usage:
#   workflow/slurm_executor/04_submit.sh                # everything
#   workflow/slurm_executor/04_submit.sh --dry-run      # show what would be submitted
#   workflow/slurm_executor/04_submit.sh --effect-size 0.15
#                                                       # just that one effect size's range
#
# Any other arguments are passed through to sbatch, e.g. --dependency=afterok:12345.
