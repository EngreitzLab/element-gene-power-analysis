# Submit the step 2b null-model array, and step 2c to merge it.
#
# Same reason as 04_submit.sh: the array range depends on NUM_REPLICATES / REPS_PER_NULL_CHUNK, and
# #SBATCH directives are read before config.sh is sourced, so the range cannot be a directive
# without going stale. It is computed here and passed on the command line, which overrides one.
#
# The merge is submitted with --dependency=afterok on the array, so the two can be launched together
# and the merge simply will not run if any chunk fails.
#
# Usage:
#   workflow/slurm_executor/02b_submit.sh              # array + merge
#   workflow/slurm_executor/02b_submit.sh --dry-run    # show what would be submitted
#   workflow/slurm_executor/02b_submit.sh --no-merge   # array only
#
# Any other arguments are passed through to sbatch.
