## WHICH NULL MODEL THE SIMULATION TESTS AGAINST =================================================
#
# This is part of the output path, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy-mindedness.
#
# The null-model configuration does not change the *shape* of a task's output -- the same
# reps x pairs rows come out under every configuration -- so nothing about a finished file
# distinguishes one from another. Step 04's resume check compares row counts, and on 2026-08-13 it
# therefore skipped all 1,000 tasks of the null_fit rerun (job 38882207) because the as_is output
# from job 38849611 was sitting at the same paths with exactly the right number of rows. The array
# reported 1,000 successes and recomputed nothing.
#
# Putting the configuration in the directory name makes that collision impossible: two
# configurations can no longer address the same file. The `provenance` sidecar written next to each
# output in step 04 is the second layer, and catches the case a directory name cannot -- the same
# configuration re-run against a *different* null-model bundle.
#
#   as_is     inherited real-data cache. Biased low by ~0.03; only for reproducing job 38849611.
#   null_fit  per-replicate null models from step 02b. The correct configuration; production default.
#   cleared   refits inside every call. The faithful reference, 4.3x the cost. Never for production.

## PIPELINE PARAMETERS ============================================================================

# Effect sizes as a *fractional decrease* in expression (0.15 = 15% knockdown).
#
# Only 0.15 for the validation run: it is the only effect size the old pipeline covers, so it is
# the only one that can be compared against. A typical production sweep is 5% to 50%:
#
#   EFFECT_SIZES=(0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50)
#
# Adding effect sizes costs CPU linearly (~635 CPU-hours each) but need not cost wall clock --
# see the N_SPLITS budget below, which trades splits against effect sizes to keep everything in
# one wave.
EFFECT_SIZES=(0.15)

NUM_REPLICATES=100     # Monte-Carlo replicates per pair
SEED=20250812          # base RNG seed
GUIDE_SD=0.13          # spread of per-gRNA effect sizes around the target effect size

## NULL MODELS (step 02b) =========================================================================
#
# Replicates per array task when fitting null models. One fit covers every gene (~237) on one
# replicate and takes ~20 minutes, so 1 per task keeps wall clock at ~20 minutes for the whole set
# instead of ~33 hours serial. Raise it only if the array-task budget is tight.
REPS_PER_NULL_CHUNK=1

## NULL_FIT VALIDATION SUBSET (steps 08-09) =======================================================
#
# How many splits to re-run under null_fit to measure what the inherited cache cost us, without
# paying for a full second sweep.
#
# The comparison is exactly paired: seeds derive from (seed, target, rep, effect_size), which does
# not involve the null model, so the simulated count matrices are bit-identical between the as_is
# run and this one. Both configurations skip the GLM fit -- one from the inherited cache, one from
# the bundle -- so RNG consumption matches too. Every difference in power is therefore attributable
# to the null model, with zero Monte-Carlo noise between the two runs. That is why 20 splits are
# decisive where 53 pairs at 5 replicates were only suggestive.
NULL_FIT_SUBSET_SPLITS=20

# Parallel tasks per effect size. Does not affect results -- seeds derive from
# (seed, target, rep, effect_size), so the pipeline is invariant to the split layout. It decides
# wall clock only.
#
# THE BUDGET THAT ACTUALLY BINDS
#
# The simulation is submitted as one 2D array over (split x effect size), so the task count is
# N_SPLITS * ${#EFFECT_SIZES[@]}. That product is capped by the QOS, not by anything about this
# pipeline:
#
#   sacctmgr show qos ->  owners  MaxSubmitJobsPU=3000  MaxTRESPU=cpu=16384
#                         normal  MaxSubmitJobsPU=2000  MaxTRESPU=cpu=512
#
# Array tasks count individually against MaxSubmitJobsPU, so a 10-effect-size sweep at 1000
# splits (10,000 tasks) is rejected at submission. MAX_ARRAY_TASKS below leaves headroom under
# the 3000 cap for the odd interactive job.
#
# Because ~all tasks run concurrently, wall clock is roughly one task's duration regardless of
# how the budget is divided -- so spend it.
#
# MEASURED cost, fitted on all 999 real tasks of job 38887744 (null_fit + gRNA precomputation
# reuse): 1.140 s per target + 0.5561 s per pair, per replicate. Over 3,026 targets and 34,886
# pairs at 100 replicates that is 635 CPU-hours per effect size predicted against 634 measured,
# down from 999 before the gRNA reuse and against the old pipeline's 1,308 -- a 2.1x speedup.
#
# Do not re-derive this from the step 3 smoke test. That gave 9.68 s per target per replicate and
# implied ~814 CPU-hours; it was measured before the gRNA reuse and on 36 targets.
#
#   effect sizes   N_SPLITS   tasks   per task    wall clock (all effect sizes)
#   1              1000       1000    ~36 min     ~40 min
#   1              2000       2000    ~18 min     ~20 min
#   2              1400       2800    ~26 min     ~30 min
#   10             290        2900    ~131 min    ~2.2 h      (6,350 CPU-hours!)
#
# Rule of thumb: N_SPLITS ~= MAX_ARRAY_TASKS / number of effect sizes. And note the last row:
# a full 5-50% sweep is 8,000+ CPU-hours simulated naively. See docs/status.md on two-stage
# replicate allocation, and the cascading-effect-size idea, for how to avoid paying it.
#
# Two other ceilings: whole targets stay together, so N_SPLITS can never usefully exceed the
# 2,798 targets; and below ~5 minutes per task the fixed costs (container start, R startup, the
# 18 MB + 50 MB reads) start to dominate. See docs/status.md on preferring more splits over more
# rep chunks.
N_SPLITS=1000

# Headroom below the QOS MaxSubmitJobsPU of 3000. check_array_budget() enforces it.
MAX_ARRAY_TASKS=2900

# Total tasks in the step 4 array, and the (split, effect size) decomposition it implies.
# Ordering is split-major within each effect size, so tasks 1..N_SPLITS are the first effect

## SLURM ==========================================================================================

# engreitz alone has 288 cores and was queueing for a long time; owners adds a few thousand, at
# the cost of being preemptible and capped at 2 days. Every request here is well under that, and
# step 4 skips already-complete tasks on resubmission, so a preempted task costs only its own
# work.
PARTITION="engreitz,owners"

# The simulation array is deliberately NOT throttled -- see the --array line in
# 04_run_power_simulation.sbatch. Throttling to %50 turned a ~20 minute run into a ~6 hour one.
# Slurm's MaxArraySize here is 1,000,000, so the array size itself is not a constraint.

## ENVIRONMENT ====================================================================================
#
# WHY EVERYTHING RUNS IN A CONTAINER
#
# Sherlock is CentOS 7 (glibc 2.17) on every node, login and compute alike. conda-forge dropped
# glibc 2.17 support after CentOS 7 reached end of life, so the r-base 4.4 builds this project
# pins require glibc >= 2.28 and pixi refuses to install them:
#
#   × Cannot install environment 'default'
#     Virtual package '__glibc >=2.28' does not match any of the available virtual packages on
#     your machine: [__glibc=2.17=0, ...]
#
# This is not something pixi can fix. glibc is a *virtual* package: conda packages link against
# the host's C library through the system dynamic loader, so pixi can only detect the host glibc,
# never supply a newer one. Refusing to install binaries that would fail at load time is the
# correct behaviour. The same is true of any userspace version manager -- mise, asdf, conda --
# for the same reason.
#
# So the environment runs inside an Ubuntu 22.04 container (glibc 2.35), which does supply its
# own C library. The alternatives were to re-solve the lockfile against packages old enough for
# CentOS 7 (discards the pinned solve, and r-base 4.4 may have no such build), or to abandon pixi
# for Sherlock's own R module (drops the lockfile as a description of what ran). The container
# keeps pixi.lock authoritative, and Nextflow supports Apptainer natively, so this carries
# straight into the Nextflow step rather than being throwaway scaffolding.
#
# The image is a stock ubuntu:22.04 with nothing added -- the pixi binary is statically linked,
# so it is simply bind-mounted in from $GROUP_HOME. To rebuild it:
#
#   APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=$SCRATCH/apptainer_cache \
#     apptainer pull $GROUP_HOME/software/containers/ubuntu2204.sif docker://ubuntu:22.04

CONTAINER_IMAGE="${GROUP_HOME}/software/containers/ubuntu2204.sif"

# Bind mounts. Apptainer binds $HOME and the current directory by default but not $GROUP_HOME or
# $SCRATCH, and every path this pipeline touches -- repo, inputs, outputs, pixi cache -- lives
# under one of those two.
#
# The third bind is CA certificates. A stock ubuntu:22.04 image ships no ca-certificates package
# at all -- /etc/ssl/certs does not exist -- so pixi cannot open an HTTPS connection and dies
# with "No CA certificates were loaded from the system". Rather than build a derived image just
# to add them, the host's bundle is mounted in and pointed at with SSL_CERT_FILE. This matters
# only while downloading; once .pixi/ is populated the runtime steps need no network.

# Bring pixi onto PATH.
#
# The module system only carries pixi/0.53.0, which reads lockfile format v6 and earlier. The
# committed pixi.lock is format v7, so 0.53.0 fails outright:
#
#   × Failed to load lock file ... The lock file version is 7, but only up to including
#     version 6 is supported by the current version.
#
# Rather than re-solve the lockfile with the older pixi -- which would discard the pinned solve
# that makes this pipeline reproducible -- a current pixi is installed as a standalone binary
# under $GROUP_HOME. It is a single static executable and needs no root.
#
# To reinstall or upgrade it:
#   PIXI_HOME=$GROUP_HOME/software/pixi curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
#
# Note that installer appends a PATH line to ~/.bashrc. Remove it: $GROUP_HOME is NFS, and PATH
# entries on slow filesystems are a documented cause of hung logins and held jobs on Sherlock.
# PATH is set explicitly below instead, which is also what makes this work identically in a
# batch job, where ~/.bashrc may not be sourced at all.
