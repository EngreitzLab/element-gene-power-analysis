## Shared CLI plumbing, so every bin/ script is a standalone executable.
##
## The old scripts read `snakemake@input`, `snakemake@output`, `snakemake@params` and
## `snakemake@wildcards`, which meant none of them could be run or debugged without invoking
## Snakemake. Each script now takes explicit arguments and works identically whether it is run by
## hand or staged by Nextflow.
##
## Also gone from every script: the save.image() block that dumped the whole workspace into
## RDA_objects/ on every task, and the sink()-based logging. Nextflow captures per-task
## stdout/stderr in .command.log, and sink() actively hurts -- it swallows output when a script
## dies before reaching close(log).
